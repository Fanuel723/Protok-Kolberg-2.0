# Automating the Protokół Kolberg 2.0 PWA with n8n

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for automating key processes of the Protokół Kolberg 2.0 Progressive Web Application (PWA) using n8n. The plan covers the identification of automation opportunities, the design of n8n workflows, and recommendations for execution, integration, and monitoring.

## 2. Identification of Key Processes for Automation

The Protokół Kolberg 2.0 PWA has several features that are prime candidates for backend automation. Automating these processes will enhance user engagement, ensure data consistency, and improve the overall reliability of the application.

- **User Registration and Onboarding:** When a user grants permission for push notifications, this is a critical event. Automation can streamline the process of capturing their subscription details and sending a welcome notification.
- **Push Notification Delivery:** Sending timely and relevant push notifications is key to user retention. This includes both broadcast messages to all users and targeted messages based on user actions.
- **Offline Data Handling:** The PWA's ability to queue data while offline is a core feature. The backend needs a reliable, automated workflow to process this data once the user's device comes back online.
- **Automated Data Processing (ASPID):** When a user uploads a document for OCR processing, an automated workflow can manage the processing pipeline, from receiving the file to notifying the user of the results.

## 3. n8n Workflow Designs

This section provides high-level designs for the n8n workflows that will automate the processes identified above.

### a. Workflow: User Registration & Welcome Notification

- **Trigger:** Webhook. The PWA will call this webhook when a user subscribes to push notifications.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Receive Subscription Data:** The webhook receives the user's push subscription object.
    2. **Store Subscription:** The subscription data is stored in a database (e.g., a Google Sheet, Baserow, or a relational database) for future use.
    3. **Send Welcome Notification:** A push notification is immediately sent to the user, confirming their subscription.
- **Diagram:**
  `[Webhook Trigger] -> [Store Subscription in DB] -> [Send Push Notification]`

### b. Workflow: Broadcast Push Notifications

- **Trigger:** Manual or Scheduled. Can be run on-demand from the n8n UI or scheduled to run at specific times.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Fetch Subscriptions:** Retrieve all active push notification subscriptions from the database.
    2. **Loop Over Subscriptions:** Use the "Split in Batches" node to iterate through the list of subscriptions.
    3. **Send Notification:** For each subscription, send the broadcast message.
- **Diagram:**
  `[Manual/Scheduled Trigger] -> [Fetch All Subscriptions] -> [Split in Batches] -> [Send Push Notification]`

### c. Workflow: Offline Data Synchronization

- **Trigger:** Webhook. This webhook is the endpoint for the PWA's background sync functionality.
- **Steps:**
    1. **Receive Queued Data:** The webhook receives a batch of data that was queued on the user's device.
    2. **Process Data:** The workflow processes the data (e.g., adds a new legend to the map, archives a document).
    3. **Store Data:** The processed data is saved to the appropriate database.
    4. **(Optional) Notify User:** Send a push notification to the user to confirm that their offline data has been synced.
- **Diagram:**
  `[Webhook Trigger] -> [Process Queued Data] -> [Store in DB] -> [Send Confirmation Notification]`

## 4. Execution and Integration in n8n

To implement the workflows described above, you will need an n8n instance. You can use n8n.cloud or self-host it.

- **Workflow Files:** The JSON files provided in this repository (`n8n_workflow_*.json`) can be directly imported into your n8n instance.
- **Credentials:** You will need to configure credentials for the services you want to integrate with. For example:
    - **Push Notifications:** You can use a service like web-push or a provider like OneSignal. You will need to configure the VAPID keys in the n8n "Web Push" node.
    - **Database:** If you use a database like PostgreSQL or a service like Google Sheets, you will need to provide the necessary connection details and authentication.
- **API Integration:** The workflows are designed to be triggered by webhooks. The PWA's frontend code (`app.js`) will need to be updated to call these webhook URLs when the relevant events occur.

## 5. Recommendations for Monitoring and Reporting

- **Execution Log:** n8n's built-in execution log is the primary tool for monitoring workflows. It provides a detailed view of each workflow run, including any errors that occurred.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling branches in your workflows. For example, if a push notification fails to send, you can have a branch that logs the error to a separate system or sends an alert to an administrator.
- **Dashboarding:** For a higher-level view, you can use n8n's data to populate a dashboard. For example, you could create a workflow that runs daily, counts the number of new user subscriptions, and logs this data to a Google Sheet. This sheet can then be used as a data source for a dashboarding tool like Google Data Studio.
